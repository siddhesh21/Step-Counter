# Step-Counter
It is an Android Application designed to track each steps taken by user with easy to understand and interactive GUI.

Previously we looked into health and nutrition in this pproject we will cover physical activity aspects of a healthy lifestyle. 

The technology for a StepCounter includes a mechanical sensor and software to count steps.

Here integrating hardware (smart phones) with the help of devices using the accelerometer and gyroscope integrated in the hardware we are able to track steps and register them as step counts with software.

This was developed using Android version 6.0+ with Android Studio version 3.3.3.0.0 Google LLC.

This was part of TY.BSc.Computer Science Semester-2 project implementation course Jan-March 2019
